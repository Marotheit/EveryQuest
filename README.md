9. **All the other tabs refer to the /everyquest frame. Only the last tab "Quest Givers" refers to the Minimap and World Map.**

**SETTING UP THE QUEST GIVERS MODULE**
1. Click on the **"Quest Givers"** tab.

3. After you checked this option the quest should look like this on the map.

If you like it like this and you don't need more details for the quests than the setting up is done. If you want more details for quests continue with the guide.

5. Back on the **"Quest Givers"** tab. Check also the **"Show Quest Names in tooltip"** option.

6. If you want more details for quests you have in the same tab an area like this:

Enable what features you like.

6. For me quests look like this on the map.

7. As you can see currently it shows all the quests in the game, there is no filtering done on them except for faction.


**APPLYING FILTERS TO THE EVERYQUEST QUEST GIVERS**

**Icon Settings for World Map and Minimap**

In the **"Quest Givers"** tab if you scroll down you would see Icon Settings.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86041526/166224437-ec0d7393-cf65-4822-99a9-a9e6df34c7a3.png)

Here you can set the size of the icons and the alpha.
What I don't like about this at the moment is the fact that both the world map and minimap are affected by this.
I don't like having the icons on the minimap also. Clutters the minimap with way too many !.
Will update the addon at some point to offer changing for one or the other.
If you want to change only one setting or the other you will need to:
1. Press Esc.
2. Go to Interface.
3. Switch to Addons Tab.
4. Click on HandyNotes. It will open the next tab for you where you can setup the icons separately.

**Quest filtering by Level**

I have added a new feature to Everyquest_QuestGivers, to be able to filter quests by level.
Simply choose the minimum and maximum level numbers and quests should be now filtered by level.

**Categories filters**

There are a bunch of categories you can filter out that are all by default enabled.
Go through each of them and disable what you don't want to see/need.

That is all. Thank you for using the improved addon. If you find any bugs or if you find any quests missing you can find me Razvan#8230 on Discord.
I am playing on ChromieCraft server so you can contact me on that Discord also.
